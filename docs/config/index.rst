Pipeline configuration
======================

This page includes links to everything needed to get started with the pipeline system.

The system's front end, :ref:`xcpEngine`, accepts two primary arguments: a
design file and a cohort file.

 * The design file parameterizes the processing streams and
   specifies the :ref:`modules` that should be run.
 * The cohort file is a list of subjects; it defines the
   inputs to the pipeline.
