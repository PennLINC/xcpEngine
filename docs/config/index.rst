Pipeline configuration
======================

This page includes links to everything needed to get started with the pipeline system.

The system's front end, [`xcpEngine`](%%BASEURL/config/xcpEngine), accepts two primary arguments: a
design file and a cohort file.

 * The [design file](%%BASEURL/config/design.html) parameterizes the processing streams and
   specifies the [modules](%%BASEURL/modules/index.html) that should be run.
 * The [cohort file](%%BASEURL/config/cohort.html) is a list of subjects; it defines the
   inputs to the pipeline.
