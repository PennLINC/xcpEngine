# Processing streams

Neuroimage processing refers collectively to the set of strategies used to convert the "raw" images collected from the scanner into appropriate inputs to group-level statistical analyses. A _processing stream_ is the specific set of routines that are selected to extract a desired modality of analytic data from a neuroimage.

In the XCP system, a standard set of processing streams is available for each supported imaging modality. Each processing stream is parameterized by a [design file](%%BASEURL/config/design). Detailed information about standard implementations of multimodal processing streams is available at the links below, organised by imaging modality.
