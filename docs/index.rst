XCP Imaging Pipeline
====================

Welcome to the homepage of the XCP image processing system.

XCP (eXtensible Connectivity Pipeline) is a bash-based, modular pipeline for processing multimodal neuroimaging data. Originally designed for confound regression and functional connectivity, pipeline functionality has since expanded to encompass numerous additional modalities. If you have specific usage questions, please open an issue on [the pipeline's GitHub page](https://github.com/PennBBL/xcpEngine).

__Important Note: we are in the process of transitioning to use `FMRIPREP` for initial preprocessing steps. The documentation is being actively updated and may be outdated in places. If you run into an inconsistency or something is unclear please post an issue on github!__
