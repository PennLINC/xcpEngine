.. warning::

   xcpEngine is no longer supported.
   xcpEngine is essentially completely configurable -- including configurations that don't make sense and would not pass peer review.
   Instead of maintaining this complex and potentially dangerous configurability,
   the most widely-used fMRI postprocessing workflows from xcpEngine are available (including for surface data) and rigorously tested/supported in XCP-D.

   For ASL preprocessing, we recommend switching to ASLPrep.
