## Overview

xcpEngine provides a configurable, modular, agnostic, and multimodal platform for neuroimage
processing and quality assessment. It implements a number of high-performance denoising approaches
and computes regional and voxelwise values of interest for each modality. The system provides tools
for calculating functional connectivity after preprocessing has been run in `FMRIPREP`, as well as
a standard toolkit for benchmarking pipeline performance. All pipelines from [our 2017 benchmarking
paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28302591) are implementable, as are the pipelines
evaluated in [the recent work of Parkes and
colleagues](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/05/156380).

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is accessible at the [pipeline's documentation
hub](http://xcpengine.readthedocs.io)

If you experience any difficulties, we suggest that you search or post to the
issues forum of the pipeline's GitHub repository.
